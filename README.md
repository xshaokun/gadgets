# SKPY

**SKPY** is the short for **Python Modules by Shaokun**. It is a python package containing several modules used by myself. Part of them are written by myself, and I will illustrate its usage if you have interests. However, there are also some modules collected from the Internet. For those, I will present the original link.

So far, the package includes the following modules:
* [fermi.py](fermi): contains the class and functions used to process the data of FERMI, a private hydro simulation code.
* `pluto.py`: contains the class and functions used to process the data from PLUTO.
* `streamplot.py`: matplotlib streamplot for uneven grids. [forked from [here](https://github.com/tomflannaghan/matplotlib/blob/streamplot-real-space-integrate/lib/matplotlib/streamplot.py)]
* [astroeqs.py](astroeqs): provides some frequently-used formulae to calculate astronomical quantities quickly.
