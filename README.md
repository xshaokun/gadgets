**gadgets** is a collection of scripts and tools which are useful and helpful during my daily research. The majority of them are written by myself, while a few of them are colloected from the internet for which I presented their original link.

* `bin`: executable scripts
* `from_int`: tools collected from internet
* `pytools`: some python tools useful in other python code
* `scripts`: unexecutable scripts which might require environment or dependencies
