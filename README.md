# SKPY

**SKPY** is the short for **Python Modules by Shaokun**. It is a python package containing several modules used by myself. Part of them are written by myself, and I will illustrate its usage if you have interests. However, there are also some modules collected from the Internet. For those, I will present the original link.

* `bin`: executable scripts
* `from_int`: tools collected from internet
* `pytools`: some python tools useful in other python code
* `scripts`: unexecutable scripts which might require environment or dependencies
